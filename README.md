# RTL-Bitmap Extension for the Starling project

Download or clone this repository and run the sample FlashDevelop project out of box. It will support the following RTL fonts and it works on Starling **prior to V2.0** at the moment. We welcome any contribution to this project to update it for Starling 2.0. Just feel free to make a pull-request.
